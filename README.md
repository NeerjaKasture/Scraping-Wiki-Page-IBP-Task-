# Scraping-Wiki-Page-IBP-Task-

This project scrapes the 'Population distribution by states/union territories (2011)' from the Wiki page of 'Demographics of India' and plots a population vs. state graph.
The first method used the read_html() method of Pandas and the second uses Beautiful Soup to parse the webpage.
